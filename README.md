# Hi there 👋
## I'm Tippi from Taiwan!!!
## 🔭 Currently studing in [National Yang Ming Chao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/)

### My hobbies:
- doing sports (espacially volleybal🏐)
- playing guitar🎸
- traveling

### Special experiences:
1. FRC (First Robot Competition)
2. Scout

> **FRC**
- The biggest robot competition for high school students 🤖

  ### I joined the `robot study club` at school and went to Australia for the competition!!! Though we didn't win the ticket to the final in Huston, but this is still an       unforgettable memory in my life. And also I have joined the volunteer team of the competition this year in Taiwan. I can't wait to enjoy the game!
